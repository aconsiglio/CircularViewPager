Contributions are very welcome. If you find a bug in the library or want a feature and think you can fix it yourself, fork and pull request and i will greatly appreciate it!

I appreciate pull requests for new features as well as bugs. However, when it comes to new features please also explain the use case and way you think the library should include. If you don't want to start coding a feature without knowing if the feature will have chance of being included, open an issue and we can discuss the feature!
